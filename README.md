1. Imports 
• Makes use of a messagebox for notifications and tkinter for the GUI.
2. Worldwide Variables: 
• Monitors the amount of draws, Player O's (computer), and Player X's (human) scores. 
3. Functions of Game Logic: 
• check_winner: Updates scores, shows messages, and looks for winning draws or combinations. 
• minimax: Uses the Minimax algorithm to determine the computer's optimal course of action. 
• Assess: Assesses the present board situation for victories and defeats. 
• best_move: Uses the Minimax function to identify the computer's ideal move. 
The computer_move function carries out the computer's move and determines the winner. 
• toggle_player: Modifies the display and switches the active player. 
• button_click: Controls the actions of the human player and initiates the computer's turn. 
To make room for a new game, use the reset_board function. 
• update_score: Modifies the GUI's score display. 
4.	GUI Setup:
•	Initializes the main window and creates a 3x3 grid of buttons for the game.
•	Displays the current player's turn and the scores.
5.	Main Loop:
•	Starts the Tkinter event loop to keep the application running.








In Tic-Tac-Toe, the Minimax algorithm is a perfect player, which means it will always make the best move to win or draw. To put it another way, if the AI is playing as X (the first player) and the human player is playing as O (the second player), the AI will never lose. 

This is an explanation of the Minimax algorithm's operation: 

Winning: The AI will always attempt to win the game by making the best move if it is playing as X. The AI will exploit any suboptimal moves made by the human player to win the game. 
Drawing: The AI will lose the game if the human player plays at their best. The game will result in a tie in this scenario. 

Losing: If the AI is playing as X, it will never lose to a human player. A human player who plays at their best might defeat the AI, though, if it is taking on the role of O, the second player. 

All things considered, the Minimax algorithm is a strong tool for playing Tic-Tac-Toe, and if you play as X, it will always play at its best.
